				<p className="h1">In search of Knowledge...</p>
				<p>
					Look — the galaxy isn’t just stars and hyperspace lanes. It’s a living, wheezing, blaster-scarred mess stitched together by bureaucracies, warlords, ancient religions, and people who think building a moon-sized laser cannon twice is a good use of resources.
				</p>
				<p>
					You’ve got over 400 billion stars, spread across three major regions: the Core Worlds, the Mid Rim, and the ever-mysterious, ever-violent Outer Rim — where law goes to die and smugglers thrive like mynocks on a power cable.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let’s talk star systems. You know what they are? They’re families of planets held together by a star that everyone ignores unless it explodes. Some systems are famous — like Tatoo system, home to the delightful hellscape known as Tatooine, where everything is beige and nobody can find a working air conditioner. Or the Alderaan system... well, was.
				</p>
				<p>
					And then there are planets. So many planets. Forest planets, ice planets, desert planets, city-planets. In Star Wars, ecosystems are apparently mono-themed — because who needs weather variation? Oh, you're a planet? Great. What do you offer? Oh, just jungle? Cool. Here, have an entire species and a war.
				</p>
				<p>
					Speaking of species — where do I start? Wookiees are brilliant engineers and can tear your arms off, but still don’t get respect. Twi'leks have a whole galaxy fetish for their lekku. Jawas are basically sentient malware. And Yoda’s species? We still don’t even know what they’re called. After decades. If that's not a galactic mystery wrapped in a green enigma, I don’t know what is.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vehicles? Oh, they’re everywhere. Speeders, walkers, tanks, skiffs — the galaxy is full of ways to crash stylishly. Just make sure the stormtroopers are in them; they'll miss everything anyway.
				</p>
				<p>
					But let’s talk starships — the sexy part. The Millennium Falcon looks like a flying hamburger, smells like burnt circuits, and outran Imperial cruisers on more than one occasion. Star Destroyers are triangles of death and impracticality. And then there are the X-Wings — arguably the most iconic rebellion-made, astromech-friendly, space-fighter hybrid to ever grace the void. Just don’t sit in one too long — no legroom.
				</p>
				<p>
					And despite all this — despite the wars, the politics, the clones, the Jedi drama, the "high ground" memes — the galaxy keeps going. Trade routes get rebuilt. Empires fall. Kids with broomsticks dream. And in some dingy cantina on a backwater moon, someone is always telling a story that starts with:
				</p>
				<p className="h3">
					“A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away…”
				</p>
				<p className="mb-5">
